And include the following javascript file before the end of the body element:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.2/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>

//react helmet?
This reusable React component will manage all of your changes to the document head.
Helmet takes plain HTML tags and outputs plain HTML tags. It's dead simple, and React beginner friendly.

npm i react-helmet
npm i --save-dev @types/react-helmet
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet
